                  <b>Operating Systems</b> Objectives and functions Operating
                  Systems (OS) serve as the core software that manages computer
                  hardware and provides an interface for users and other
                  software to interact with the computer system.

            <h3>Objectives and functions of operating systems</h3>
            <br />
            <br />
            <ol>
                  <b>Memory Management</b>: The OS allocates and manages computer
                  memory to ensure efficient utilization and protection of processes
                  from interfering with one another. It handles memory allocation,
                  deallocation, and swapping processes in and out of memory as needed.
                  <br><br /></br>
                  <b>Processor Management</b>: The OS schedules and manages the
                  execution of processes, ensuring fair and efficient utilization of
                  CPU resources. It allocates CPU time to different processes and
                  manages their state transitions.
                  <br><br /></br>
                  <b>Device Management</b>: The OS controls and coordinates the use of
                  hardware devices such as printers, disks, and network interfaces. It
                  provides a standardized interface for software applications to
                  access these devices without needing to understand their low-level
                  details.
                  <br><br /></br>
                  <b>File System</b> Management: The OS manages the storage and
                  organization of files on secondary storage devices (e.g., hard
                  drives). It provides a hierarchical structure for file storage,
                  maintains metadata about files (e.g., permissions, ownership, and
                  <br>timestamps), and ensures data integrity and security. <br /></br>
                  User Interface: The OS provides a user interface that allows users
                  to interact with the computer system. This interface can be a
                  command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI),
                  enabling users to execute commands, run applications, and manage
                  <br>files and settings. <br /></br>
                  <b>Process</b> Management: The OS creates, executes, and terminates
                  processes (instances of running programs). It provides mechanisms
                  for process synchronization and communication to allow processes to
                  cooperate and share data when needed.
                  <br><br /></br>
                  <b>Security</b>: The OS enforces security measures to protect the
                  system and its data from unauthorized access, malicious software,
                  and other security threats. This includes user authentication,
                  <br>access control, and data encryption.</br>
                  <br />
                  <b>File</b> and Data Access: The OS manages data access, ensuring
                  that applications can read and write to files while preventing data
                  corruption or conflicts between concurrent processes accessing the
                  <br>same files.</br>
                  <br />
                  <b>Error</b> Handling: The OS detects and handles errors and
                  exceptions that may occur during the execution of programs or
                  interactions with hardware. It attempts to recover from errors and
                  <br>prevent system crashes or data loss.</br>
                  <br />
                  <b>Virtualization</b>: Some modern operating systems support
                  virtualization, enabling the creation of multiple virtual machines
                  (VMs) on a single physical machine. These VMs can run separate
                  operating systems and applications, allowing for more efficient
                  hardware utilization and better resource isolation.

            <h3>Evolution of Operating Systems</h3>
            <br />
            <ol>
                  <b>Simple</b>: In the context of computing, "simple" typically
                  refers to a straightforward, easy-to-understand, or uncomplicated
                  design or implementation. It often implies a system or solution that
                  lacks complexity or advanced features. Simplicity is often favored
                  when it leads to more manageable systems, better maintainability,
                  <br>and reduced chances of errors.</br>
                  <br />
                  <b>Batch</b>: Batch processing refers to a method where data or
                  tasks are collected, processed, and executed in groups or batches
                  rather than individually or interactively. Batch processing is
                  commonly used for large-scale, repetitive tasks, such as data
                  processing, bulk printing, or file transfers. Instead of processing
                  one item at a time, batch systems process a collection of items in a
                  single operation, making it more efficient for certain types of
                  <br>tasks.</br>
                  <br />
                  <b>Multi</b>-programmed: Multi-programming, as mentioned before, is
                  a technique used in operating systems to maximize CPU utilization by
                  simultaneously executing multiple programs or processes. It allows
                  the operating system to keep the CPU busy even when certain programs
                  are waiting for I/O operations or other resources. By interleaving
                  the execution of different programs, multi-programming can enhance
                  <br>overall system performance.</br>
                  <br />
                  <b>Time</b>-shared: Time-sharing is a method of computing where
                  multiple users interact with a single computer or system
                  concurrently. Each user is given a small time slice or quantum
                  during which they can execute commands and access resources on the
                  shared system. The operating system rapidly switches between users,
                  giving the illusion of real-time responsiveness and ensuring fair
                  <br>resource allocation among multiple users.</br>
                  <br />
                  <b>Parallel</b>: Parallel computing involves the simultaneous
                  execution of multiple tasks or processes to achieve faster and more
                  efficient computation. This is typically accomplished by dividing a
                  large problem into smaller subproblems, and each subproblem is
                  solved simultaneously on multiple processing units (e.g., CPU cores,
                  GPUs, or even separate computers). Parallelism can significantly
                  reduce the time required to complete complex tasks, making it a
                  <br>valuable approach for computationally intensive applications.</br>
                  <br />
                  <b>Distributed</b> Systems: Distributed systems are collections of
                  interconnected computers or nodes that collaborate and share
                  resources to accomplish a common objective. Each node operates
                  autonomously and communicates with others through a network. The
                  distribution of tasks and data across multiple nodes allows for
                  scalability, fault tolerance, and improved performance. Distributed
                  systems are often used in large-scale applications like cloud
                  <br>computing, peer-to-peer networks, and distributed databases.</br>
                  <br />
                  <b>Real-Time Systems</b><b>:</b> Real-time systems are computing
                  systems designed to respond to events or inputs within strict time
                  constraints. They must produce results or actions within
                  predetermined time limits to ensure correct operation and safety.
                  
                  Real-time systems are used in various critical applications, such as
                  industrial control systems, aviation, medical devices, and
                  autonomous vehicles, where timely responses are essential to avoid
                  dangerous situations or system failures.
